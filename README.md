# Michał Kanios - About Me
👋 Hi! My name is Michał. I'm an aspiring front-end web developer from Poland with a burning passion for digital art and graphic design. My approach to life is to never stay stagnant and always be ambitious. "Mastery" and "perfection" are inherently counterproductive to growth - you can always be better, don't settle for less.
