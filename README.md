  ### Additional Skills
🎲🧙‍♂️My experience as a Game Master for several "Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition" TTRPG campaigns and how it can be of use:
- Role-playing each week amounts to weekly creativity and conflict resolution exercises, improving consistency and improvisation skills.
- Designing engaging game sessions for my players amounts to extensive knowledge about game design principles.
- Managing 6-7 players every game has trained me in multitasking and taught me the value of teamwork.
